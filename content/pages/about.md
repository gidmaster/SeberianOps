## whoami

I'm GidMaster — a DevOps engineer with 15+ years in the field.
Based in Saint Petersburg, working with CI/CD, Kubernetes, Docker,
Linux, and clouds. Originally from Tomsk, Siberia.

I also teach DevOps online — breaking down complex infrastructure
concepts into things that actually make sense.

This blog is where I write down what I learn, what breaks,
and what I figure out along the way.

## what you'll find here

- DevOps notes from real projects
- Kubernetes and Docker war stories  
- Bash and Python scripts that solved actual problems
- Live updates from the terminal
- Some studing materials

## stack

This site is built with FastAPI and Python. Posts are Markdown files stored in git repo.
No JavaScript frameworks. Hosted on my own server.

Source code will be on [GitHub](https://github.com/gidmaster/SeberianOps) eventually.

## Barcelona

My cat. Named after football club. But we usually call him Barsik. Unimpressed by uptime guarantees.
